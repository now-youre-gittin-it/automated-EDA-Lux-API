# automated-EDA-Lux-API
API that performs typical EDA on data. I've used the Superstore dataset for analysis in this project.<br>
The LUX API constructs easily interpretable plots by reading the dataframe in the LUX-activated working environment. <br>

Some of the standard widgets supported under the LUX module are as follows.

- Correlation
- Distribution
- Occurrence
- Geographical

Created visualizations, explored drill-down capabilities, export options and finally deployed exported html as Streamlit component.
