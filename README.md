# automated-EDA-Lux-API
API that performs typical EDA on data. I've used the Superstore dataset for analysis in this project.
The LUX API constructs easily interpretable plots by reading the dataframe in the LUX-activated working environment. <br>
Visualizations are produced in an interactive widget with various feature tabs to slide through and understand the characteristics of the data.

Some of the standard widgets supported under the LUX module are as follows.

- Correlation
- Distribution
- Occurrence
- Geographical
